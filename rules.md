**101:**

All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-118 (immutable) and 201-206 (mutable).

---

**102:**

Initially, rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

---

**103:**

A rule change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal or amendment an amendment, or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

---

**104:**

If they are to pass, rule changes must be proposed in the proper way and voted on. They will be adopted if and only if the required number of votes are received.

---

**105:**

Every player is an eligible voter. All eligible voters may vote on all rule changes. Failure to confirm or deny a rule change due to insufficient votes is a rule infringement on the part of all eligible voters who do not vote.

---

**106:**

All proposed rule changes must be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they must guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

---

**107:**

No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive application.

---

**108:**

Each proposed rule change must be assigned an ordinal number and must be formally referred to by that number. The numbers must begin with 301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way must receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it is assigned the ordinal number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it is assigned the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, it is assigned the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

---

**109:**

Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules are to be be adopted if and only if the ratio of "yes" votes to "no" votes is 2:1 or greater.

Other legal rule changes are to be be adopted if and only if the rule change receives more "yes" votes than "no" votes.

---

**110:**

A rule change's vote is finalized once either all eligible voters have voted, a majority of eligible voters have voted "yes," a majority of eligible voters have voted "no," or 24 hours have passed since the vote began.

---

**111:**

If and only if less than five rule changes are being voted on at a given time, any player may propose a rule change. A player whose rule change is currently being voted on, however, may not propose another rule change.

---

**112:**

If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical or destructive of play, is held by a player to consist of two or more rule changes compounded or to be an amendment that makes no difference, or it otherwise held to be of questionable value, then the other players can suggest amendment or argue against the rule change before the vote. The proponent, however, decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and chooses the time to end debate and vote.

---

**113:**

A player always has the option of forfeiting the game rather than continuing to play or incurring a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player incurring the penalty, may be imposed.

---

**114:**

There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.

---

**115:**

Rule changes that in any way affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes that repeal part or all of their own authority are permissible. No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely because of its self-referential properties.

---

**116:**

The adoption of rule changes is permissible only when a rule or a set of rules makes it permissible. Otherwise, whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is allowed and unregulated.

---

**117:**

A player is defined as a single human organism. Separate accounts on Discord do not constitute separate players.

---

**118:**

Once a player wins this game, they will be paid all money sent my (Kimber's, Ash's, Your) way for the purpose of this game. The game will also end; all rules will be null and void.

---

**201:**

An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.

---

**202:**

Each player always has exactly one vote.

---

**203:**

If an immutable rule and a mutable rule conflict, the immutable rule must take precedence. If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence. If at least one of the conflicting rules explicitly says that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), such provisions must supersede the numerical method of determining precedence. If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, the numerical method must again govern.

---

**204:**

If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, a vote will be held to settle the dispute. The terms for the finalization of this vote are the same as that of a rule change, except that the maximum duration of the vote is halved. Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of at least two players.

---

**205:**

If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with finality, or a vote conducted per rule 204 cannot be resolved, then the winner is chosen at random among all players who cannot continue the game without violating one or more rules. This random selection will be conducted publicly and transparently.

---

**206:**

Once adopted, all rules are to be written down in this file in this repository. They are to be sorted in ascending order by their assigned ordinal number.
