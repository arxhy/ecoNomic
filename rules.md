**101:**

*Immutable.*

All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-118 (immutable) and 201-209 (mutable).

---

**102:**

*Immutable.*

Initially, rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

---

**103:**

*Immutable.*

A rule change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal or amendment of an amendment, or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

---

**104:**

*Immutable.*

If they are to pass, rule changes must be proposed in the proper way and voted on. They will be adopted if and only if the required number of votes are received.

---

**105:**

*Immutable.*

Every player is an eligible voter. All eligible voters may vote on all rule changes. Failure to confirm or deny a rule change due to insufficient votes is a rule infringement on the part of all eligible voters who do not vote.

---

**106:**

*Immutable.*

All proposed rule changes must be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they must guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

---

**107:**

*Immutable.*

No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive application.

---

**109:**

*Immutable.*

Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules are to be be adopted if and only if the ratio of "yes" votes to "no" votes is 2:1 or greater.

Other legal rule changes are to be be adopted if and only if the rule change receives more "yes" votes than "no" votes.

---

**112:**

*Immutable.*

If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical or destructive of play, is held by a player to consist of two or more rule changes compounded or to be an amendment that makes no difference, or it otherwise held to be of questionable value, then the other players can suggest amendment or argue against the rule change before the vote. The proponent, however, decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and chooses the time to end debate and vote.

---

**113:**

*Immutable.*

A player always has the option of forfeiting the game rather than continuing to play or incurring a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player incurring the penalty, may be imposed.

---

**114:**

*Immutable.*

There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.

---

**115:**

*Immutable.*

Rule changes that in any way affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes that repeal part or all of their own authority are permissible. No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely because of its self-referential properties.

---

**116:**

*Immutable.*

The adoption of rule changes is permissible only when a rule or a set of rules makes it permissible. Otherwise, whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is allowed and unregulated.

---

**117:**

*Immutable.*

A player is defined as a single human organism. Separate accounts on Discord do not constitute separate players.

---

**118:**

*Immutable.*

Once a player wins this game, they will be paid all money sent my (Kimber's, Ash's, Your) way for the purpose of this game. The game will also end; all rules will be null and void.

---

**201:**

*Mutable.*

An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.

---

**202:**

*Mutable.*

Each player always has exactly one vote.

---

**203:**

*Mutable.*

If an immutable rule and a mutable rule conflict, the immutable rule must take precedence. If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence. If at least one of the conflicting rules explicitly says that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), such provisions must supersede the numerical method of determining precedence. If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, the numerical method must again govern.

---

**204:**

*Mutable.*

If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, a vote will be held to settle the dispute. The terms for the finalization of this vote are the same as that of a rule change, except that the maximum duration of the vote is halved. Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of at least two players.

---

**205:**

*Mutable.*

If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with finality, or a vote conducted per rule 204 cannot be resolved, then the winner is chosen at random among all players who cannot continue the game without violating one or more rules. This random selection will be conducted publicly and transparently.

---

**206:**

*Mutable.*

Once adopted, all rules are to be written down in this file in this repository. They are to be sorted in ascending order by their assigned ordinal number.

---

**207:**

*Mutable.*

If a player violates a rule, a vote is to be held deciding whether the player should be disqualified. The vote is to be finalized once either all eligible voters have voted, a majority of eligible voters have voted "yes," a majority of eligible voters have voted "no," or 24 hours have passed since the vote began. Once the vote finalizes, if the vote has received more "yes" votes than "no" votes, the player will cease to be a player.

---

**301:**

*Mutable.*

Players are assigned as many points as a player's proposal gets positive votes. If the proposed rule passes, the number of points the player is assigned are doubled. Point totals above or below 0 must be kept track of via the player's nickname in Discord.

**302:**

*Mutable.*

At any time, a player may declare a Blood Oath, which they are bound to obey. Each player may only have one active Blood Oath at a time.

If a player's Blood Oath is paradoxical or unenforceable, or if it has been violated, any other player with a Blood Oath may start a vote to declare them Forsworn.

If a majority of players with Blood Oaths agree, excluding the player being voted on, then that player becomes Forsworn, and their Blood Oaths are immediately nullified.

A vote to declare a player Forsworn is finalized once either all eligible voters have voted, a majority of eligible voters have voted "yes," a majority of eligible voters have voted "no," or 24 hours have passed since the vote began.

The votes of players with active Blood Oaths have double strength.

**304:**

*Mutable.*

Players may introduce Guidelines which are recommendations for other players to follow. Guidelines are stored in an analogous manner to rules and are kept historically. Guidelines function analogously to rules according to rules 103-107, 110, and 111. Guidelines take precedence according to their title, according to lexicographical order.

If no rule changes have been proposed in the last 7 days (168 hours), the player who proposed a rule change most recently wins the game.

Any player joining the game has 0 points. This applies to players who leave and rejoin.

A rule change's vote is finalized once either all eligible voters have voted, a majority of eligible voters have voted "yes," a majority of eligible voters have voted "no," or 24 hours have passed since the vote began.

**311:**

*Mutable.*

Each proposed rule change must be assigned an ordinal number and must be formally referred to by that number. The numbers must begin with 301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way must receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it is assigned the ordinal number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it is assigned the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, it is assigned the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

Once per proposal, a single player may challenge the player who suggested it to a duel for the ability to veto the proposal. The challenge must be made in general chat and the challenger may not participate in another challenge for the next Once per proposal, a single player may challenge the player who suggested it to duel the player who suggested it for the ability to veto the proposal. The challenge must be made in general chat and the challenger may not participate in another challenge for the next 48 hours. The contents of the duel will be a game agreed upon by both participants.

The proponent of the proposal may choose another player to defend the proposal provided that player is willing.

If the proponent does not respond or refuses to duel, the challenger may add, change, or remove up to three words in the proposal to change its effect. This change takes effect after voting or immediately upon refusal. This change must be grammatically correct and may not change any players status as players or winners of the nomic game.

Players may trade points.

The concept of "culture" is introduced as a points system separate from the points system outlined by 301. Culture points, or just "culture", is awarded to players who are formally praised by other players, and subtracted from players who are formally chided by other players. 5 culture is awarded or subtracted per praise/chide. A player is awarded 100 culture points per every cultural guideline that they propose and which is subsequently passed.

It is possible to achieve a Cultural Win by accumulating 10,000 culture.

**317:**

1. A player may, at any time, propose a rule change, as long as they do not already have a proposal in the queue.
2. Proposed rule changes are entered into the queue.
3. The oldest proposed rule-changes in the queue are moved to the voting booth, as long as less than 5 proposals are in the voting booth.
4. Rule changes in the voting booth are voted on in the manner described other rules
5. After the vote has finalized, no matter the result of the vote, the proposal is removed from the voting booth.

All votes are to be held in the #poll channel on the "moon viewing ceremony" Discord server that all players are in. Players who wish to propose a rule change or other vote, but who are unable to post to the #poll channel, must post their proposal in the #proposals channel in this server. The proposal is to then be transferred to #poll within 24 hours by someone who is able to do so.
